#### FAST_LIO_SLAM_ros2
Parts of this repository are based on the
[FAST_LIO_SLAM_ros2](https://github.com/rohrschacht/FAST_LIO_SLAM_ros2) project
by rohrschacht, which itself is a ROS 2 port of FAST-LIO developed by the
HKU-MARS group.

We have copied and modified the original FAST_LIO_SLAM_ros2 code to integrate
it with our SLaRC HeavySeeker platform, including:
- Adaptation to our ROS 2 workspace layout and launch structure
- Parameter and configuration changes for the Livox MID-360
- Additional launch files and ROS integration for 3D SLAM experiments
